# First International Workshop on BRIdging the Divides with Globally Engineered Software

## About
The objective of the International Workshop on BRIdging Divides with Globally Engineered Software (BRIDGES) is to foster development by providing a forum where researchers and practitioners can report on and discuss issues and solutions to bridge the digital divide of information within a practical geographic-free global software engineering setting.

The workshop encourages the exchange of ideas within the local and international community with its ultimate goal to make software engineering universal; for anyone, anywhere, even without rich platforms, from technically, culturally, or educationally. It is a round-table discussion with invited talks from both local and international participant discussions.
