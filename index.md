### 12th - 14th September 2019

**First International Workshop on BRIdging the Divides with Globally Engineered Software (BRIDGES2019)**

## About
The objective of the International Workshop on BRIdging Divides with Globally Engineered Software (BRIDGES) is to foster development by providing a forum where researchers and practitioners can report on and discuss issues and solutions to bridge the digital divide of information within a practical geographic-free global software engineering setting.

The workshop encourages the exchange of ideas within the local and international community with its ultimate goal to make software engineering universal; for anyone, anywhere, without any technical, cultural and educational boundaries. This involves a round-table discussion with invited talks from both local and international participants.

## Organizers 
- Raula Gaikovina Kula (Organizer, Nara Institute of Science and Technology)
- Christoph Treude (Organizer, University of Adelaide)
- Hideaki Hata (Organizer, Nara Institute of Science and Technology)
- John Genolagani (Local, University of Papua New Guinea)
- Sharon Torao-Pingi (Local, University of Papua New Guinea)

Due to limited space availability, DAY2 and DAY3 attendance at the workshop is by invitation only.

## Venue
BRIDGES2019 will take place at a conference room at the University of Papua New Guinea (UPNG), Waigani Campus (Day 1) and Motupore Island Research Center (Day 3), which is located on an island off the coast of Port Moresby, capital of Pacific nation, Papua New Guinea (PNG). Known as the land of unexpected, locals speak over 850 languages and have a diverse culture, flora and fauna (like the Bird of Paradise and the world's largest butterfly, the Queen Alexandra Birdwing), making PNG one of the last untouched locations on the planet. With independence day looming on September 16th, we expect the area to be buzzing with pacific-style culture and experiences.
